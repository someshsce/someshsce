## 🚀 **About Me**
I specialize in applying LLMs, voice interfaces, and vision models to build intelligent, real-world AI systems. My work spans agentic automation, offline AI assistants, and cognitive architectures that combine perception, reasoning, and adaptive behavior.
<br><br>
Currently pursuing M.Tech in AI & Data Science at IIT Patna, where I’m exploring multimodal human–AI interaction systems.
